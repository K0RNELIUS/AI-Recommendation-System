# AI-Recommendation System
Team: Leandro Beloti Kornelius & Lucca Magalh√£es<br>


The project is a movie recommendation system that utilizes the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to enhance our understanding of machine learning.
Recommendation systems are prevalent in modern activities such as marketplaces, advertisements, and content platforms. 
These systems utilize artificial intelligence and various parameters to provide personalized suggestions to users.

The Naive Bayes model is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between data points. 
It calculates the probability of an instance belonging to a category based on predetermined conditions or parameters. 
In contrast, KNN is a supervised learning method that finds similar items based on the nearest items. 
Cosine similarity was used to measure the distance in this project due to the utilization of words in relevant aspects of the database.

Due to size limitations in Git repositories, the dataset had to be removed.
To run the code, download the following files: credits.csv, keywords.csv, and movies_metadata.csv.
Place these files in the project's main directory to successfully execute the algorithms developed by the team.

If you encounter any problems in the setup or would like to help us improve the system, please contact me through my email (leandro.kornelius@gmail.com) for us to chat.
Thank you!
